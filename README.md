Bullet
======

Bullet is a Cowboy handler and associated Javascript library for
maintaining a persistent connection to the server irregardless of
the browser used and the technologies available.

Bullet defines a common interface both client and server-side to
facilitate the handling of such connections. Bullet also takes care
of reconnecting automatically when the connection is lost, and of
the optional heartbeat managed client-side.
